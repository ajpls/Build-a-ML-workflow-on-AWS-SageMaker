# Build-a-ML-workflow-on-AWS-SageMaker

In this project, an image classification model was built with AWS SageMaker for Scones Unlimited, to automatically detect types of delivery vehicles (bicycles and motorcycles) in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. The system can assist Scones Unlimited to optimize their operations by assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther away.
